# User-to-User Chat Fixes

## Problem Analysis
The user-to-user chat wasn't working because:
1. **Limited Block Range**: Only searching recent 5000 blocks, missing historical registrations/messages
2. **Event Filtering Issues**: Not properly capturing all relevant message events
3. **User Registration Scope**: Only showing current user's registration events

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Block Range Extension
**Files**: `useUserHistory.ts`, `useUsers.ts`
- Changed from limited range to search from genesis block (0)
- This ensures all historical user registrations and messages are captured

### 2. Message Event Filtering Enhancement
**File**: `useUserHistory.ts`
- Fixed to include ALL global messages (to address(0))
- Fixed to include ALL private messages where current user is sender OR recipient
- Removed restrictive filtering that was excluding valid messages

### 3. Private Message Filtering Logic
**File**: `chatInterface.tsx`
- Enhanced filtering logic for private conversations
- Proper address comparison (case-insensitive)
- Clear logging to debug message matching

### 4. User Registration Events
**File**: `useUserHistory.ts`
- Now includes ALL user registration events, not just current user's
- This populates the sidebar with all registered users

## Testing Steps

### To Test User-to-User Chat:

1. **Check User List**:
   - Open the app and verify users appear in sidebar
   - Check browser console for "Found user registration logs: X"
   - Verify users are loaded from blockchain events

2. **Test Private Messaging**:
   - Select a user from the sidebar
   - Send a private message
   - Check console logs for message filtering
   - Verify message appears in conversation

3. **Debug Data Flow**:
   - Visit `/debug` page to see raw blockchain data
   - Check contract address and events
   - Verify message and user registration events exist

## Debugging Tools Added

### 1. Enhanced Console Logging
- Block range information
- Event filtering decisions  
- Message inclusion/exclusion reasons
- User registration data

### 2. Debug Page (`/debug`)
- Shows raw blockchain event data
- Displays contract address and block range
- Lists all user registrations and messages found

### 3. Component-Level Debugging
- Chat interface logs message filtering decisions
- Sidebar logs user loading status
- History hook logs event processing

## Next Steps

If issues persist:

1. **Check Network Connection**:
   - Verify connected to correct blockchain network
   - Ensure contract address is correct
   - Check if there are actually other registered users

2. **Verify Contract Events**:
   - Use blockchain explorer to check if `UserRegistered` events exist
   - Verify `MessageSent` events are being emitted correctly
   - Confirm contract is deployed at the expected address

3. **Test Message Sending**:
   - Try sending a private message and check transaction
   - Verify IPFS upload is working
   - Check if message events are being emitted

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
- `src/hooks/useUserHistory.ts` - Fixed event filtering and block range
- `src/hooks/useUsers.ts` - Extended search range, added logging  
- `src/components/chatInterface.tsx` - Enhanced private message filtering
- `src/components/sidebar.tsx` - Added user loading debug info
- `package.json` - Disabled turbopack to fix dev server issues

### New Files:
- `src/app/debug/page.tsx` - Debugging tool for blockchain data
- `USER_TO_USER_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes:
1. **Sidebar** should show all registered users (excluding current user)
2. **User Selection** should work when clicking on users
3. **Private Messages** should be sent and received correctly
4. **Message History** should load previous conversations
5. **Console Logs** should show the data flow clearly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No Users in Sidebar**:
   - Check debug page for user registration events
   - Verify contract address is correct
   - Ensure searching from block 0

2. **Messages Not Appearing**:
   - Check console for message filtering logs
   - Verify IPFS hashes are valid
   - Check if events are being emitted by contract

3. **Cannot Send Messages**:
   - Check wallet connection
   - Verify user is registered
   - Check IPFS upload functionality
