# Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
The frontend was experiencing hydration errors due to server-side rendering (SSR) mismatches. This occurred because:

1. **Blockchain Data Dependencies**: The app relies on blockchain data (wallet connection, user registration status) that's not available during SSR
2. **Dynamic Content**: Components were rendering different content on server vs client
3. **State Dependencies**: React state that depends on client-side APIs (wagmi hooks)

## Solution

### 1. Custom Hydration Hook (`useHydration.ts`)
```typescript
export function useHydration() {
  const [isHydrated, setIsHydrated] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    setIsHydrated(true);
  }, []);
  return isHydrated;
}
```

### 2. ClientOnly Component (`ClientOnly.tsx`)
A wrapper component that only renders children on the client side:
```typescript
export const ClientOnly: React.FC<ClientOnlyProps> = ({ 
  children, 
  fallback = null 
}) => {
  const isHydrated = useHydration();
  if (!isHydrated) {
    return <>{fallback}</>;
  }
  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

### 3. LoadingScreen Component (`LoadingScreen.tsx`)
Consistent loading UI across the app:
```typescript
export const LoadingScreen: React.FC<LoadingScreenProps> = ({ 
  message = "Loading..." 
}) => {
  // Returns consistent loading UI
};
```

### 4. Dynamic Rendering
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static generation issues.

## Implementation

The main page now uses a structured approach:

1. **Server-side**: Shows a consistent fallback UI
2. **Client-side**: Renders the full app with blockchain integration
3. **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
4. **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling

## Benefits

- ✅ No more hydration errors
- ✅ Consistent user experience
- ✅ Proper loading states
- ✅ SEO-friendly fallback content
- ✅ Better performance with proper SSR handling

## Usage

Wrap any component that depends on client-side data:

```tsx
<ClientOnly fallback={<LoadingScreen />}>
  <YourBlockchainComponent />
</ClientOnly>
```

This ensures the component only renders after hydration is complete, preventing SSR mismatches.
